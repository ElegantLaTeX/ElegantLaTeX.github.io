I don’t change any default command or environment, which means you can use all the basic LaTeX commands and environments as before. Besides, I deﬁne 4 commands

1. `\email`: create the hyperlink to email address.
2. `\ﬁgref`: same usage as `\ref`, but start with label text __Figure n__.
3. `\tabref`: same usage as `\ref`, but start with label text __Table n__.
4. `\keywords`: create the keywords in the abstract section.
