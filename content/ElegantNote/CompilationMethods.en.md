You can use `PDFLaTeX` or `XeLaTeX` to process your notes. 

+ If you are using PDFLaTeX, `ctex` package is used;
+ If you are using XeLaTeX , `xeCJK` package is called when processing Chinese characters.

The test environment is Win10 + TeX Live 2018. If you are using a Mac/Linux
system and compiled with `XeLaTeX`, please change the font in elegantnote.cls with your system font.

__Note:__ If you are using `PDFLaTeX`, you do not need to change the font settings.
