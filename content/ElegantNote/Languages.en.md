This template contains two sets of language environments, changing the language environment will change the title of table/Ô¨Ågure (figure, table), article structure words (such as the table of contents, references, etc.), and the environment introductory words (such as Theorem, Lemma, etc.). The different language modes are enabled as follows:

```tex
\documentclass[cn]{elegantnote}
\documentclass[lang=cn]{elegantnote}
\documentclass[en]{elegantnote}
\documentclass[lang=en]{elegantnote}
```

Note You can input Chinese Characters in either environment.
