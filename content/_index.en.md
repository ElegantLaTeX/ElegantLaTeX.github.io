The [ElegantLaTeX](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX) program is established in 2013 by [Ethan Deng](https://ddswhu.me/) and [Liam Huang](https://liam.page/). The first template is [ElegantNote](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantNote) which is designed to simplify the work of taking notes. In the following years, [ElegantNote](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantNote) is re-designed for notes, and [ElegantBook](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantBook) is renewed as book template on the basis of [original ElegantNote](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantNote/releases/tag/v1.00). Last year, we started the new project of [ElegantPaper](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantPaper) designed for writing working papers. The goal of [ElegantLaTeX](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX) program to design elegant and beautiful LaTeX templates is unchanged these years.

Elegant LaTeX, Elegant Life.
