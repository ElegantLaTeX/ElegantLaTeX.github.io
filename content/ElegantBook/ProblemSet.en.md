The environment `problemset` is used at the end of each chapter to display corresponding exercises. Just type in the following sentences:

```tex
\begin{problemset}
  \item exercise 1
  \item exercise 2
  \item exercise 3
\end{problemset}
```

And you will get:

**Notice** If you want to customize the title of  `probleset`, please change the optional argument like introduction environment.

```tex
\begin{problemset}[Hello World]
  \item ...
\end{problemset}
```
