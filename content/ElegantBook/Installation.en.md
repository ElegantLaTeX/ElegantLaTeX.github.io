Both portable version and installation package are available for this template.

### Portable Version

For portable version, simply download lastest ElegantBook-master from Github or CTAN (to be more accurate, download elegantbook.cls) and save the file(s) under your working directory. This way of installation is simple and convenient, but you have to manually update cls now and then.

### Installation Method

If you are a TeX Live 2019 user, using the `tlshell` of TeX Live 2019 direct installation package is strongly recommended. Simply search and open `tlshell`, click on `File -> Load Default Repository` or customize repository by Options. Wait till the repository loads successfully, search elegantbook by name, installation and update is just a click away.

If you are a TeX Live 2018 user and would like to update to TeX Live 2019, the official solution is to uninstall 2018. If you want to save the bother of uninstallation and installation, please copy `elegantbook.cls` to the installation directory of TeX Live 2018 (default: `C:\texlive\2018\texmf-dist\tex\latex\elegantbook` ), run `texhash` in cmd.

Excuse me? You are a  CTeX user? Sorry, this template is incompatible with CTeX.
