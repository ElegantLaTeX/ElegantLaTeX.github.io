On the occasion of this release, we, ElegantLaTeX Program, want to reintroduce our work to you. We are committed to creating a series of beautiful, elegant, easy to use LaTeX templates for users. The ElegantLaTeX is currently composed of [ElegantNote](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantNote), [ElegantBook](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantBook), [ElegantPaper](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantPaper) for typesetting notes, books, and working papers respectively.

The latest version is available on [Github:ElegantBook/releases](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantBook/releases). This guide describes some settings of this template and how to use it. If you have any other questions, suggestions or comments, please feel free to contact us.

## ElegantBook Updates

Over these years, we’ve received a lot of feedback from users, with major issues related to font installation, coding support, theorem class environments ﬂoats, theorem cross-page, cross-references, and etc. We really think about these problems, it wasn’t elegant to let the user install the font for visual beauty since users got into a lot of trouble, which went against the concept of our template. So we’ve removed that from the new version, users don’t have to install any fonts. Let’s take a look at the ElegantBook template 3.x updates:

1. Remove custom font settings and use the `ctex` package or system font instead;
2. Add English and Chinese modes（`lang=cn/en`);
3. `PDFLaTeX` and `XeLaTeX` Support;
4. Use the `tcolorbox` package to re-written the theorem class environments, which can span over pages;
5. Theorem class environments name updated, and cross-references fixed;
6. Color name updated, link color unified;
7. New ElegantLaTeX Logo;
8. New cover and decorations, remove the watermark;
9. Fix appendix;
10. Add gray theme: `color=plain`;
11. Add code highlighting;
12. Beautify the list environment.
