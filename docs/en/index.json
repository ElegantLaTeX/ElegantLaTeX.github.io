	"content": "This template was originally designed to take notes and was conceived in 2013. In the ﬁrst version, we designed a series of beautiful theorem environments and introduced 3 different color themes. But when taking notes using this template, we found there were so many theorem blocks which makes the notes not pretty. So we decided to update the ElegantNote to the ElegantBook template. The design of ElegantNote stopped there.\nIn 2018, after being \u0026ldquo;urged\u0026rdquo; by some users, ElegantBook received a major update, the original ﬂoating theorem environments are rewritten with tcolorbox package. After that, we want to completely redesign the ElegantNote template. We are in favor of more compact, simpler theorem environments, and aim to design an Elegant LaTeX template which is more suitable for note taking and note reading.\nWith the advice and inspiration of some friends, we redesigned the new ElegantNote template based on the Standard LaTeX article class! The new template has the following features:\n good for eye mode: with green page color; different devices: Pad (default), Kindle, PC (double-page) and normal (A4); 5 color themes: green (default), cyan, blue, sakura, black; languages support: Chinese (default), English; support PDFLaTeX and XeLaTeX ; prettier captions, list environments, and uniﬁed fonts.  Just enjoy it! If you have any questions, suggestions or bug reports, you can create issues, pull requests or email us at elegantlatex2e@gmail.com.\nThis work is released under the LaTeX Project Public License, v1.3c or later.\n"

We are committed to creating a series of beautiful, elegant, easy to use LaTeX templates for users. The ElegantLaTeX is currently composed of ElegantNote, ElegantBook, ElegantPaper for typesetting notes, books, and working papers respectively.\nThe latest version is available on Github:ElegantBook/releases. This guide describes some settings of this template and how to use it. If you have any other questions, suggestions or comments, please feel free to contact us.\nElegantBook Updates Over these years, we’ve received a lot of feedback from users, with major issues related to font installation, coding support, theorem class environments ﬂoats, theorem cross-page, cross-references, and etc. We really think about these problems, it wasn’t elegant to let the user install the font for visual beauty since users got into a lot of trouble, which went against the concept of our template. So we’ve removed that from the new version, users don’t have to install any fonts. Let’s take a look at the ElegantBook template 3.x updates:\n Remove custom font settings and use the ctex package or system font instead; Add English and Chinese modes（lang=cn/en); PDFLaTeX and XeLaTeX Support; Use the tcolorbox package to re-written the theorem class environments, which can span over pages; Theorem class environments name updated, and cross-references fixed; Color name updated, link color unified; New ElegantLaTeX Logo; New cover and decorations, remove the watermark; Fix appendix; Add gray theme: color=plain; Add code highlighting; Beautify the list environment.

Example Environments: including example, exercise, problem environment, auto numering within chapter.

Conclusion Environments: including conclusion, assumption, property, remark, solution environment, all of these begin with boldfaced words, and the contents are the same as a normal paragraph.  Theorem Class Environments The template uses the tcolorbox package to customize the theorem class environments, it is slightly different from the normal theorem environments. The usage is as follows:\n\\begin{theorem}{\u0026lt;theorem name\u0026gt;}{\u0026lt;label\u0026gt;} The content of theorem. \\end{theorem}  The ﬁrst parameter \u0026lt;theorem name\u0026gt; is the name of the theorem, and the second parameter label is the label used in cross-reference with ref{thm:label}.
